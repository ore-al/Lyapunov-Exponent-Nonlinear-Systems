# Lyapunov-Exponent-Nonlinear-Systems
Copyright @VibRoLab
The main MATLAB script to obtain the Lyapanov exponent is "Lyapunov_HHIM_nondim_ODE45" 
The script "Initial_conditions_for_LEcode" needs to be run before "Lyapunov_HHIM_nondim_ODE45"
The other files included are function files used in the scripts above
